Getting a Image for a Brand From Twitter.
I have always found a need to get a logo for a name, may be a Brand Name, Organization or anything. No public serivce is available for this.
For this use case I have found a simple way of getting it from twitter.

For this use case, we will get the list of nouns from a brand name and search for users on twitter with those nouns.
In the list of users so retreived we will use the profile image of user which as highest Followers/Following ratio.
